## Spicy Orange Chicken

# Spicy Orange Chicken with Optional Additions

## Ingredients

- 12-15 breaded chicken tenders
- 1 cup orange juice
- 1/4 cup honey or sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons vinegar (preferably rice vinegar, but white vinegar will also work)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- Zest of 1 orange
- 1/2 cup water
- Sliced green onions and sesame seeds for garnish

**Optional Spicy Additions:**

- 1-2 jalapenos, diced
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Sriracha to taste

**Optional Complex Flavor Additions:**

- Stir-fry vegetables (bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, or bok choy)
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- Toasted sesame oil
- Fresh orange segments
- Chopped cilantro
- Toasted almond or cashew nuts

## Instructions

1. Cook the breaded chicken tenders according to the package instructions. 

2. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the orange sauce. In a small saucepan, sauté the minced garlic and ginger if using. Then, add the orange juice, honey or sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, diced jalapenos, and cayenne pepper. Heat over medium heat until the sugar or honey is dissolved.

3. In a separate bowl, mix the cornstarch with the water until it's completely dissolved.

4. Slowly pour this cornstarch mixture into the saucepan with the orange sauce, stirring constantly.

5. Continue to cook the sauce on medium heat until it thickens, usually about 5 minutes. Drizzle in a small amount of toasted sesame oil if using.

6. Once the chicken tenders are cooked, place them in a large bowl. Pour the orange sauce over the chicken and toss to make sure all pieces are coated.

7. Top the chicken with the orange zest, and garnish with sliced green onions, sesame seeds, fresh orange segments, chopped cilantro, and toasted nuts if desired. Add sriracha to taste.

8. Serve your Spicy Orange Chicken over steamed rice or noodles. If using stir-fry vegetables, you can sauté them separately and serve them alongside the chicken, or mix them into the dish at the end.
